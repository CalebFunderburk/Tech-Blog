# Tech Talk

## About this App

### Description

Tech Talk is a CMS-style blog website where users can create an account and talk about the latest trends regarding tech.

### User Story

As a user looking for a way to discuss the latest trends in technology, I would like an application that allows me to see and review discussions, as well as interact with posts from other users regarding tech. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a chronological list of posts from other users.

### Features

* Tech Talk was developed using the MVC Paradigm: Sequalize is used to manage the databse while Handlebars.js allows for the display of dynamic data to users.
* The application also uses the express-session npm package to authenticate user sessions and conditionally render content on the page.
* Because this application runs on an Express.js server, it has been deployed using Heroku.
